# Model-check every TLA+ spec with TLC. Exits non-zero if any spec fails.
#
# Requires Java + tla2tools.jar. Point TLA_TOOLS at the jar, or drop it in
# ~/.local/share/tla/tla2tools.jar (download:
#   https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/latest/download/tla2tools.jar).
# A JDK 11+ works; corretto-21 via mise is what this was verified with.
#
# -deadlock (i.e. skip TLC's deadlock check) is applied ONLY to SignSpec: its
# terminal states (Signed/SignFailed/SignRejected) are genuine sinks — the Elm
# Sign machine has no reset. WalletSpec and TransactionSpec have no sinks
# (UserConnect / TxReset are always eventually enabled), so they get the full
# deadlock check.
